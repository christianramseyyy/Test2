# Description
In this test, we were instructed to use correct git operations to implement test cases, and update github/project board accordingly. For each test case, I created a new task, created a branch for that tesk, implemented the test case, committed it to the separate branch, and then did a pull request and merged that branch into the main branch, so that the code is available with the rest of the code in the main branch.
